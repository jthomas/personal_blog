    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10982490_10100164397395871_2816996236474834286_n.jpg?oh=2767b19a56218ae3d9b29ec96ff25c01&oe=557E2FF7"></p>

<p>Visiting Manchester last month presented an opportunity for a weekend walk in the Peak District. Winter had returned with a vengeance that week, with heavy snow across the National Park. People were skiing down the face of Mam Tor and ice climbing up Kinder Downfall. Definitely not a regular occurrence&hellip;</p>

<p>Recent trips to the Peak District have concentrated on Kinder Scout, the popular moorland plateau between Manchester and Sheffield. Looking for something more remote, Bleaklow was an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Bleaklow&rsquo;s a <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleaklow">&ldquo;peat covered, gritstone moorland, just north of Kinder Scout, across the Snake Pass (A57), in the Derbyshire High Peak near the town of Glossop. Much of it is nearly 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and it is the source of the River Derwent.&rdquo;</a></em></p>

<p>Bleaklow feels far more remote than Kinder Scout. Fewer walkers visit the area. Large expanses of featureless moorland, with deep peat groughs and without a plateau edge like Kinder, can make the area extremely disorientating.</p>

<p>Navigating across the moorland can be a challenge during summer. Winter conditions, with deep snow and ice, provided a great opportunity to practice my navigation skills further.</p>

<h2>Planned Route</h2>

<iframe src='https://connect.garmin.com/activity/embed/699538547' width='465' height='500' frameborder='0'></iframe>


<p>Starting at Glossop, parking near Mill Pond, we planned to head up Yellow Slacks clough, following the ridge to Dog Rock. Continuing along Dowstone Clough before turning south to find Lower and Upper Shelf Stones. From the trig point above Higher Shelf Stones, walking north-east to Hern Stones. Walking north from here to Wain Stones and Bleaklow Head, stopping for lunch.</p>

<p>Returning along the Pennine Way, past Hern Stones and Hern Clough, until the crossing with Doctor&rsquo;s Gate. We would then follow this path back along the brook to our starting location.</p>

<p><em>Well, that was the plan&hellip;</em></p>

<h2>Best Laid Plans&hellip;</h2>

<p>Arriving at Glossop, there was no snow on the ground but the surrounding hills were a different story. Heading along the river, opposite Shire Hill, until we verved off the path up Shittern Clough to the ridge above Yellow Slacks.</p>

<p>Getting above four hundred metres, the moorland began to disappear under a thin covering of snow. The depth increased as we climbed higher, ankle deep above five hundred metres.</p>

<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10983422_10155171663475092_1487896897203765697_n.jpg?oh=fcb51e54d610d18a53cd239a31f93b34&oe=5580F865&__gda__=1437530368_e5e7b6e48c43eda0c689deb4e60d03d0"></p>

<p>Hitting Dog Rock, we rose above the low cloud base, covering the landscape with a thick clag. We couldn&rsquo;t see further than fifty to seventy metres in any direction.</p>

<p>We had planned to <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">hand-rail</a> the fence along Dowstone Clough until it ended, and then walk on a bearing to the Trig Point at Higher Shelf Stones.</p>

<h3>Snow covered moorland</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the fence didn&rsquo;t seem to exist any more.</p>

<p>There was a series of  fence posts, now partially obscured by the snow, indicating where the fence once stood. These posts became more infrequent before disappearing altogether.</p>

<p>This fence was parallel to the brook running up Dowstone Clough, making it an obvious <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">handrail</a> substitute. We decided to follow the river much further along, before hitting a prominent fork, before turning off for the Trig Point.</p>

<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/1505470_10155171663825092_4397147666091263027_n.jpg?oh=2ef40c6f00d3d71f1f5e0ca97c4e75b7&oe=557D42CF"></p>

<p>We would have to <a href="http://www.mcofs.org.uk/estimating-distance-travelled.asp">pace out</a> the distance to the Trig Point due to the lack of other navigational features.</p>

<p>Continuing along the <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">handrail</a>, rather than stopping at the fence end, reduced the length of our next navigation leg, from over a kilometre to five hundred metres.</p>

<p>The landscape was now expansive moorland, crossed by deep peat groughs, covered with thick snow. Traversing up and down these trenches, with snow drifts up to your waist, made accurate <a href="http://www.mcofs.org.uk/estimating-distance-travelled.asp">pacing</a> difficult.</p>

<p><em>Reducing the length of each navigation leg would help to counter this challenge.</em></p>

<p>With the snow obscuring <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/ticking-off-features.shtml">tick-off features</a>, e.g. connecting streams, along our handrail, we resorted to using timing to confirm the fork we reached was correct.</p>

<p>Taking a bearing to the Trig Point, we set off pacing the distance to Higher Shelf Stones.</p>

<h3>Higher Shelf Stones</h3>

<p>Counting double-paces to measure hundred metre intervals, we continued for five hundred metres before hitting&hellip; <strong>nothing.</strong></p>

<p>Later on, reviewing my GPS trace of the route, we had drifted slightly to the east. Poor visibility meant we were unable to find it from a quick visual search. Assuming we were somewhere to the east or west of the location, we walked due east for hundred metres and then reversed our steps for two hundred metres west. Here we hit the Upper Shelf Stones and then found the Trig Point.</p>

<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/10959917_10155171664230092_4011153869465993755_o.jpg"></p>

<p>Due to the lack of significant elevation change on the surrounding ground, we had to try both directions before finding our target.</p>

<p><em>We could have prevented this error, using the <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">&ldquo;aiming off&rdquo;</a> technique when taking our bearing.</em></p>

<p>Given the challenges finding the Trig Point, we decided to change the target for the next navigation leg. Heading for the Pennine Way would prove easier to find, being a well-established paved path, rather than the Hern Stones.</p>

<h3>Finding the Pennine Way</h3>

<p>Pacing and timing were used to navigate over the bearing for seven hundred metres.</p>

<p>It would normally take <a href="http://www.mcofs.org.uk/estimating-distance-travelled.asp">sixty paces, and seventy two seconds, to cover one hundred metres of flat ground at a normal walking speed</a>.</p>

<p>Scrambling up and down deep snow banks whilst stopping every fifty metres to find a new <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">attack point</a>, had an affect on the accuracy of my pacing and timing calculations.</p>

<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10858393_10155171665565092_8759069232056536006_n.jpg?oh=6601a5a227b69c43e9a29a10b46ea8cc&oe=557D4816&__gda__=1438109033_3bcb9216949ce25b84dd049d488bb328"></p>

<p><strong>Not taking this into account led to overestimating the distance we walked and making a &ldquo;parallel error&rdquo;.</strong></p>

<p>Hitting our estimated distance, we came across a wide peat grough with a fork further north. This description matched the river we were expecting, which was actually fifty metres further east, running alongside the Pennine Way.</p>

<p>The snow-covered landscape wiped out all existing paths. This meant we couldn&rsquo;t use the Pennine Way as an additional feature to confirm our location. Without the snow, the missing path would have confirmed we were in the wrong place.</p>

<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10968299_10155171664730092_3576614597550349222_n.jpg?oh=70189cdf54699c0e6f8994750271f302&oe=55B2F080&__gda__=1433406463_7cc32603498d180a9daab41ecae59130"></p>

<p><em>We were now further west than we realised.</em></p>

<p>Next stop was the Wain Stones, without the Pennine Way to follow, we had to walk north on a bearing. Having learnt from our previous difficulty finding the Trig Point, we <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">&ldquo;aimed off&rdquo;</a> to the east. Using the prominent stones around Bleaklow Head as a <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/catching-features.shtml">&ldquo;catching feature&rdquo;</a> to ensure we didn&rsquo;t walk too far, before turning west.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/aiming-off.shtml">&ldquo;aimed off&rdquo;</a> by a greater distance than our earlier error. Heading for one hundred metres east of the Wain Stones, which ended up being fifty metres, but still further east enabling us to hit our <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/safety/catching-features.shtml">catching feature</a>.</p>

<h3>Lunch at Wain Stones</h3>

<p>Stopping for lunch at Wain Stones, the sun began to break through the low-lying cloud.</p>

<p>Bringing camping stoves meant we were treated to freshly cooked bacon baguettes and hot coffee. Definitely an improvement over squashed sandwiches and lukewarm tea! Chris also brought the radio to listen to the Arsenal vs Tottenham match.</p>

<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10968372_10155171664830092_9161828737790974782_n.jpg?oh=f1679818111ef1367d195a4f94f2cd09&oe=557FCD2A&__gda__=1437796181_0bb5c0e234fcbdf8ca28d62558f9d7cd"></p>

<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/10393972_10155171664960092_4427453912132848285_n.jpg?oh=94f96c0db850015a167b814283a28213&oe=55B43CF8"></p>

<p>With the sun shining, football on the radio and breakfast cooking, Bleaklow felt for a brief moment, less, well, bleak.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, we started our walk back home.</p>

<h3>Heading Home</h3>

<p>Following a bearing south for nearly two kilometres, we were heading for Crooked Clough as a linear feature to intercept. The brook was significant enough to be visible even with the heavy snow. Estimating our time to cover the distance allowed us to double-check our location.</p>

<p>Heading away from Bleaklow Head, we came across one of the many aircraft wreckages on the moor. It was an eerie sight, the snow-covered aircraft strewn across the land.</p>

<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/1456032_10100164397834991_6635012036973711340_n.jpg?oh=d0ac383db97950457cf4c0e7ebafa20c&oe=55BA05D9&__gda__=1437438688_e7a54ca17ab6dc674ab163ae18ec8645"></p>

<p>Bleaklow was definitely felt very remote during our trip. We didn&rsquo;t see another person all day, closest we came was once hearing faint voices somewhere out there through the clag.</p>

<p>Sun continued to break through the cloud as we headed home. This increased visibility and with an easier route coming back, navigation was much simpler on the return leg.</p>

<p>Arriving at Crooked Clough, we followed the ridge along until the Doctor&rsquo;s Gate path finally came into view. Dropping down, following the river, the snow began to disappear and we even got a blue sky!</p>

<p>Less than an hour later, we were back at the car. Definitely felt like returning to the normal world after the remote, snow-covered landscape of Bleaklow.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We had a fantastic day walking in the more remote areas of the Peak District. While you may be only ten kilometres from civilisation, the vast open moorland in winter conditions feels extremely remote, desolate and wild.</p>

<p>Successfully navigating challenging conditions gives you a great sense of accomplishment. It&rsquo;s great to put those skills you practice during good weather and visibility to use for real. Trips to the Lake District, Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons during the winter has given me opportunities to build my confidence walking and navigating safely under winter conditions.</p>

<p>Looking back at this trip, there&rsquo;s a number of useful hints to consider when planning a route during difficult conditions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reduce leg distances.</strong> Having more route legs, with shorter distances between them, will allow you to reduce the chance of errors. Navigational drift increases the further you walk. Walking long distances on a bearing is easier when you have great visibility and lots of terrain features to confirm your position.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heavy snow will wipe out smaller terrain features.</strong> Paths, streams and fences can all be covered. We mistakenly assumed the Pennine Way would be visible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pacing and time across uneven terrain.</strong> Make sure you adjust the pacing and timing counts for the condition underfoot. We should have added extra paces to the pace count for the undulating terrain and decreased our estimated walking speed significantly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use attack points that are unlikely to change</strong>, i.e significant terrain features. Fences get removed, streams dry up, forests are cut down. The fence we saw on the map, was no more!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GPS as a backup.</strong> We did have a GPS for recording our route and emergency use. However, we could used it for confirming our location at important points, e.g. when we made the parallel error, or when re-locating. Winter conditions make the consequences of a mistake much greater, it&rsquo;s worth having this tool available.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/1610875_10155145827370092_4684168703150899792_n.jpg?oh=a2499de429d9c3f952c0fdd452ca652a&oe=558E3766&__gda__=1435804726_27b6e1f160b0149330c159928f7f43b4"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.alpkit.com/products/brupot">Alpkit&rsquo;s BruPot</a> got a sustained &ldquo;field test&rdquo; on my recent wild camp, combined with the <a href="http://www.vango.co.uk/gb/outdoor-essentials/386-compact-gas-stove.html#">Vango Compact Stove</a> and <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/bushcraft/QE105.html">Primus&#8217; Wind-shield</a>. Anodised titanium cooking pot, one litre capacity, with heat exchanger on the base to maximise heating efficiency. Handles wrap round the pot during storage. Rubber lid, with drinking hole, along with an insulating cover for the sides. Marks on the inside for 250 millimetres increments make measuring water easy.</p>

<p>Pot sold standalone (£20) or with a stove in their <a href="https://www.alpkit.com/products/brukit">BruKit package</a> (£35).</p>

<p>Using in the evening and morning, boiling water for my meals and coffee, with no issues. Boiling time somewhere between five and ten minutes, wasn&rsquo;t paying particular attention, despite the very cold temperatures.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/bushcraft/QE105.html">Primus&#8217; Wind-shield</a> was another great addition to my micro-cooking setup. Slots over the gas cannister when not in use, which can both be stowed inside the BruPot.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, mini-stove is marginally too large to fit inside the BruPot with the cannister and windscreen. This extra space can be handily used for lighters, fire stick or coffee sachets.</p>

<p>This micro-cooking setup has now replaced the flask in my rucksack. Having a stove allows you to make multiple brews on a trip and even hot lunches. Weight and space differences compared to a flask seem negligible.</p>

<p><em>Extremely impressed with the BruPot. Buying outdoors gear is normally choosing two from cheap, light and robust. Alpkit&rsquo;s BruPot has all three.</em></p>

    <updated>2015-02-11T14:16:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesthom.as/blog/2015/02/11/winter-wild-camping-brecon-beacons</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10941021_10155145827240092_8942377643846403791_n.jpg?oh=236f0ca2e0caf1043f6f169e8a434587&oe=5559ADD2"></p>

<p>With the last weekend in January approaching, there was just enough time to get this month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/microadventures-3/year-microadventure-2/">#microadventure</a> completed.</p>

<p>Cold weather had brought heavy snow to UK&rsquo;s mountain, perfect winter walking conditions.</p>

<p>Living in the South East, the <a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/">Brecon Beacons</a> were my destination.</p>

<p>Rather than travelling up Saturday morning, wild camping the night before would give me an early start the next day. This would allow me to get ahead of the masses descending on Pen Y Fan during the weekend.</p>

<p>Weather forecasts for the weekend were continuing to be <em>alpine</em>, strong winds and snow expected overnight and throughout the following day. Looking for a place to camp, priorities were a low-lying spot in a local valley, protecting me from the worst of the wind and snow, with walking access to the Brecon&rsquo;s highest peaks.</p>

<h2>Wild Camping at Cwm Llwch</h2>

<p>Hunting online for hints to wild camping sites in the Brecons, wild campers are reluctant to give exact locations on public forums due to fears about overuse, yielded an excellent suggestion along the Nant Cwm Llwch river, south from Llyn Cwm Llwch, a small lake beneath Pen Y Fan.</p>

<p>Looking for further information about the location, led me to realising I had  been there before! It&rsquo;s the Race HQ for the Pen Y Fan Fell Race, day one in the <a href="http://www.breconfans.org.uk/">Brecon Fans Race Weekend</a>. This was my first ever fell race, in a very short fell running career (the second race the following day was my last!).</p>

<p>The site comes with permission from the farmer to wild camp there, for a very modest payment in the morning (£3 pppn), which allows you to relax on the usual &ldquo;wild camping rules&rdquo; e.g. pitching your tent at dusk, leaving at sunrise and not leaving tents pitched during the day. They also allow open camp fires, an activity normally violating the &ldquo;leave no trace&rdquo; ethic when wild camping on open access land. The Nant Cwm Llwch river curves around the site, providing easy access to water. Cars can be safely parked near the entrance gate.</p>

<p>Continuing onward along the track leading into the field, you can follow the river straight to its source, the secluded lake hiding at the foot of the northern face of Pen Y Fan. Well-worn paths from the lake guide you up to the ridge around this rock hollow, carved out during a previous glacial era, and onwards to popular peaks, Corn Du and Pen Y Fan.</p>

<p>Overall, the location easily justifies the small payment required to stay there. Heading further up towards the lake, there are plenty of spaces to wild camp without permission (and payment) but you lose the ability to have open fires and leaving tents pitched during the day, etc.</p>

<p>During my stay, there was only one other solitary camper in the area and it definitely felt &ldquo;wild&rdquo; enough. Returning from my walk the next day, there were half a dozen cars parked by other walkers along the entrance. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine, during the summer, this pitch would be busy, with cars parked and people camping, that it would lose the &ldquo;wild camping&rdquo; feeling. This wasn&rsquo;t a problem camping during January (sub-zero temperatures seem to keep people away&hellip;)!</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no official information about this site online, in proper wild camping style, here&rsquo;s the grid reference: SO 00656 24449</strong>.</p>

<p>Ground temperatures were falling to freezing overnight, wind chill was definitely going to take it below zero. Definitely a night for a tent over a bivy bag! Perfect opportunity for testing the <a href="http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Tents/Vango-Apex-200-2013/">Vango Apex 200</a>.</p>

<h2>Vango Apex 200</h2>

<p>Lightweight adventure two-man tent, although it&rsquo;s more one man and gear, weighing in at 1.7 kg. Small enough to pack inside a thirty litre rucksack.</p>

<p>Pitching instructions were straightforward. Once the tent had been fully pegged out, the tension-band system can be connected to provide extra stability during high winds. Unnecessary during my trip, but tent seemed rock solid with this additional support. Looking forward to a proper field test in bad weather.</p>

<p>Head room&rsquo;s tight, being over six foot, but felt fairly spacious apart from that. Small porch provides a cooking area during bad weather or space for storing your boots.</p>

<p>Pegs included with the tent were poor, too short and didn&rsquo;t appear very robust. Wouldn&rsquo;t trust them to hold guy lines in high winds. Usable as ground sheet pegs, providing the ground was soft. Replaced guy line pegs with <a href="http://www.cleats.co.uk/browse-by-product/tent-pegs/cl622-alloy-y-tent-peg-pack-of-6.html">titanium Y spikes</a> for additional stability.</p>

<p>With tent pitched, dinner cooked and darkness closing in it was time to retire to the warmth of my sleeping bag.</p>

<h2>Winter Camping Setup</h2>

<p>With sub-zero temperatures due overnight, this was the first real test of my  winter sleeping gear, painstakingly hunted down from Ebay over the summer. Sleeping bag was an early version of the current <a href="http://www.facewest.co.uk/Mountain-Equipment-Snowline.html">Mountain Equipment Snowline</a>. Used this on top of the <a href="http://www.exped.com/usa/en/product-category/mats/synmat-7-m">Exped Synmat 7</a> inflatable sleeping mattress.</p>

<p>Sleeping bag and mat coped comfortably with the temperatures. Woke up at 4am to discover feeling far too hot, had to open side zips on the sleeping bag to cool down! Both items have a low temperature rating of -17 c, giving me confidence using the same set-up on even colder nights.</p>

<p>Opening the entrance in the morning, revealed a light covering of snow on the ground, which indicated heavier dumps on the surrounding peaks. Leaning out from my micro-climate, stove was started to boil water for my luxury breakfast - instant porridge and &ldquo;3 in 1&rdquo; coffee mix.</p>

<h2>Best laid plans&hellip;</h2>

<p>Plan had been to walk to the lake, tracing the path up around the rim and then along to the <a href="http://www.walkscene.co.uk/description_51/Brecon_Four_Peaks_Corn_Du_Pen_y_Fan_Cribyn_Fan_y_Big.html">four peaks</a> (Corn Du, Pen Y Fan, Cribyn, Fan Y Big) before returning home on the same path. Unfortunately, the weather had over ideas&hellip;</p>

<p>Walking along the river towards Pen Y Fan, the path climbs slowly through fields with sheep and past farm buildings until hitting the boundary fence marking &ldquo;open access land&rdquo;. Snow covering the hills started to become deeper above 400 metres, paths and streams disappearing. Low-lying cloud swallowed the peaks above.</p>

<p>Reaching the lake, the briefest of indentations on the westerly hills, now covered with thick snow, gave away where the path once lay. Plunging through  snow up to my knees, the increasing gradient made a tough climb to the rim surrounding the lake.</p>

<p>Path followed the bowl&rsquo;s rim, passing Tommy Jones Obelisk. Snow covering the path turned into ice.</p>

<p>Crampons came out.</p>

<p>Strong winds funnelled up the valley over the edge, blowing spindrift everywhere. Forecast wind speeds were thirty, gusting to over forty, miles per hour. Snow goggles made a huge difference.</p>

<p>Reaching the cloud base, visibility dropped further.</p>

<p>Heading along the Craig Cwm Llwch ridge, conditions deteriorated. Gusts of wind, rising in intensity, meant staying upright became difficult.</p>

<p>After half a kilometre struggling onwards, with two hundred metres to the first summit, I made the decision to turn around.</p>

<p>Severe winds, full-on winter conditions and being alone had made me begun to feel uncomfortable continuing. Forecasts predicted increasing wind speeds throughout the day.</p>

<p>Recorded a short video of the conditions before reversing the path back down to the lake.</p>

<p>Slowly retracting my foot steps, conditions back at the tent were a different world, the overnight snow melted and calm winds.</p>

<p>Looking back towards Pen Y Fan, the afternoon had brought an unexpected calm to the weather. Summits free from cloud, the sun breaking through and a lull in the winds. How annoying!</p>

<p>Throwing the unpacked tent in the car boot, driving home earlier than planned meant being back in time to watch the football.</p>

<p>Wild camping in winter has advantages compared to the summer months. Trips have a more adventurous feel, you&rsquo;re unlikely to be sharing popular spots with others and later sunrises mean you can get a lie in! Warmer sleeping bag and mat, extra clothes for the evening and you can extend &ldquo;sleeping under canvas&rdquo; to all four seasons.</p>
